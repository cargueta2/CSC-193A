  <h1 style="color:white">Favorite Thriller/Horror Movies to Wacth for Halloween</h1>

  <p style="color:white; font-size: 20px">Every October, I like to watch one or two horror movies on the weekends. Some
    of the movies I like to watch have some <strong>sci-fi, thriller or supernatural</strong> aspects to them so I watch
    a mix of those
    leading up to Halloween. On the weekend before Halloween, my sisters and I order pizza and grab some snacks and have
    a movie marathon. We watch some of the classics like <strong>Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street, the Scream
      series</strong> and some
    of our own favorites. Some of my favorites are: <strong>the Descent, REC, 28 days later</strong>and some other ones,
    but my absolute
    favorite is <strong><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_Encounters>Grave Encounters</a></strong>.</p>
